### BY LANGSTON HUGHES

      What happens to a dream deferred?

            Does it dry up
            like a raisin in the sun?
            Or fester like a sore—
            And then run?
            Does it stink like rotten meat?
            Or crust and sugar over—
            like a syrupy sweet?

            Maybe it just sags
            like a heavy load.

            *Or does it explode?*
